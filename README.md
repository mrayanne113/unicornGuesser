# Unicorn Guesser
Fun extension of [Number Guesser](https://mrayanne113.github.io/number-guesser/) 

This was a Turing School of Software and Design project extension. I took a the simple number guesser game and make it fun for kids. Each time you level up the colors change and you save a unicorn. Can you save them all?
